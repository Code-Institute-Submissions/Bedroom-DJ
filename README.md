# User Experience (UI)
---

## Project Goals


To protray a fictional character called **DJ Snooze-A-Lot** & who is Ireland's longest serving Bedroom DJ. 
I will create a website firstly, to have a laugh at my expense but more importantly, to display the skills I have learned so far.
I just want people to have a laugh when they visit my website & enjoy the nostalgia of the 90's rave scene as well.
Ye never know though, maybe I'll become famous ..... Bedroom DJ to World SuperStar DJ **ALL** because of my website. 
How cool would that be ha ha ?


## User Goals


* Have a laugh at my expense
* Learn about the Northern Irish Rave scene
* My Top 10 Rave Tunes from back in the day (with either YouTube links built in or associated pics for each tune)
* Humerous section about up & coming tour dates / mixes / live mixes with a maximum audience of 5 allowed at my window
* Be able to listen to some 90s classics
* Updates on future raves, oldskool reunions


## User Stories


* As a user, I want to see who this crazy person that is Ireland's longest serving Bedroom DJ, actually is
* As a user, I want to have a laugh and have a smile on my face
* As a user, I want to enjoy some old classic rave tunes that I may never have heard before
* As a user, I want to enjoy am aesthetically pleasing website which is easy to navigate around
* As a user, I want to be taken back to a muddy field in the middle of nowhere, early 90s and lost in the music


## Site Owner Goals


* As a site owner, I want to make sure site visitors smile & laugh
* As a site owner, I want them to connect and love the fictional character that is DJ Snooze-A-Lot
* As a site owner, I want people to enjoy some top tunes from the 90s
* As a site owner, I want like minded ravers to relive their youth through my website
* As a site owner, I want set up a mailing list for future CD sales and updates. Also a competetion possibly on sigh up.
* As a site owner, I want people to wonder who is the man behind this crazy facade that is Irelands longest Bedroom DJ


## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements

* Scrolling website
* Professional looking website which is aesthetically pleasing
* 5 or 6 sections depending on overall look and how compact it may look
* As much funny shit as possible but in a professional manner (if possible)
* To have an email sign-up form for DJ updates, future CD's and live mixes plus a wee competetion to win a CD on sign-up

### Expectations

* The user will smile as a bare minimum but laugh if I consider my wee website a success
* They will enjoy the websire layout and navigate freely with no issues
* Good working links (pics or videos) will be provided to access my Top 10 Classics Tunes
* That fellow ravers reminisce about the good old days
* Fun stories with shit puns is always a winner in my eyes


## Design Choices

To be honest, at the start I was all for UV lighting, bright neon colours, flashing strobes and as 90s ravery (not a word but I'm using it) as I could get.
But the more I thought about it, it would have looked really awful and loud .... probably hurt the eyes to be fair. So in my head before I start to design it,
I want to keep my website relatively simple, I am going to keep it chilled out and deffo give it a relaxed feel, well until my Top 10 section ... OI OI !!!
I did some research on famous DJs amd their associated websites, just to see what kind of information is displayed there. 
Some were very similar to what I had in mind before I previewed them so I was pleasantly pleased. Some were very compact with a lot going on in such a small space.
Anyway, simple but funny is key to my design

### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration :)
Personally, I would have used big bold graffiti style fonts but I know in my heart this would have looked pretty awful to the user. 
So I have settled on the simplicity side of things & the more user friendly style of [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web)
for the main text and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) for titles and section headings.

Below is an example of my fonts where the title is in Lato and the text is in Titillium Web .....

### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require. 
I will deffo be using the various social media icons out there on my website.
Other than them, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.


### Colours

Unfortunately, the 90s rave scene was historically as bright and as luminous as you could get. Whites, luminous yellows, luminous oranges .... the brighter the better !
My website will not be as bright unfortunately, even though I really love the colours but I will need to tone it down to make it more aesthetically pleasing for my visitors :)
So the colours I have mainly settled for are :

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***Cultured***        |#F8F9FA    |Off White          |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Lavender Floral*** |#B696ED    |Soft Purple        |Body background, menu selections|
|***Fiery Rose***      |#EB5C68    |Soft Red           |Body background, menu selections|
|***Charleston Green***|#212529    |Off Black          |Body background, text & titles  |

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

# Wireframes
---
The software that I used for my **wireframes** was [***Balsamiq***](https://balsamiq.com/).
This was the first time I used such software so it was a whole new learning curve for me. 
The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile.
They are just simple 2D sketches but I have quickly found out how important these really are:)

You can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

- [Desktop Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/Bedroom-DJ/raw/master/wireframes/desktop-wireframe.pdf)
- [Tablet Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/Bedroom-DJ/raw/master/wireframes/tablet-wireframe.pdf)
- [Mobile Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/Bedroom-DJ/raw/master/wireframes/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

When I first started thinking about how my website was going to look, I automatically thought on a multi-page design as that's what I was used to seeing on the internet.
After my initial discussion with my cool mentor, he said a scrolling single page would be more suitable to my design and content.
I realised this was the correct direction when designing my wireframes and also when researching other websites out there.


### What didn't make the cut

# TBC

# Features
---
Features that have been implemented into my website are :


* A *navbar* to enable easy navigation for the user to any section of their desired choice.
* An aesthetically pleasing visual experience as they scroll through my website.
* Social and music links located within the footer.
* Some classic oldskool rave tunes from the early 90s on display, for joyful and heart pumping reminiscence purposes :)
* Some humour to enlighten their day.
* Finally, a ***hidden link*** somewhere on the webpage, to one of my special oldskool mixes, but where ... who knows (well me actually ha ha).

Features that could be implemented into my website possibly in the future, could be :

* A **My Mixes** section .... once I get off my @ss and do more of them (although I'm doing this wee course so won't have time for a while)
* With more experience, I'd like a bit more animation added to make it more interactive.
* Maybe a CD or Rave pack selling section ... make a few quid and buy a better laptop with a bigger screen (eyes are killing me here like).
* More raves stories but not all mine, maybe users could attribute to like in a comments section or in a forum, as Rave Stories are the ulimate stories because we got up to all sorts of mad stuff.
* Obviously, new Tour Dates as in a few months the current ones will have expired and I will have wrecked bedrooms all around the world.

I know this is my first site

# Bugs
---
Before October 2020 the only encounter I had with websites was viewing them as a so called 'user'.
Fast forward 3 months and I'm fairly close to handing in my first MS1 project and therefore my first ever website .... unbelieveable.
I knew it was gonna be tough at times due to my inexperience but me, being stubborn and persistant, kept going & learning everyday.
One day I sat for 2 to 3 hours trying to figure out why my code ain't working .... fecking TYPO !!! But you learn from such dishearting experiences ha ha, believe me :)

Anyway, it's all about bugs and not the wee bed bugs seeing I'm a Bedroom DJ !!!

I'll be honest, I deffo thought I would have more bugs and issues than I actually had, seeing I'm a Coding NOOB.
The majority of bugs were basically as mentioned above, typos or syntax errors or a missing end **div**.

So what bugs or issues did I find ...
  
  

## The Development Journey

**Bug 1** 

On my first lonesome outing in the world of coding .... I fecked up my **'read me'** file and had to start again lol !  

So I added a funny pic, added loads of read-me content, added my index.html and started this too. Sorry, at this point 
I was only learning and did not realise it was in your best interest to ***git commit*** regularly.   
Onwards thy storyteller .... I then did a *git status* , not really paying attention to what it said ny the way, followed but a *git add*.
Finally a *git commit* saying "Initial commit, read me started, index.html created & started".   
 All good I'm thinking to myself :), let's see *git status* ....  

***Your branch and ' origin/master' have diverged, and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively ! (use git pull ... etc)***   

Well I didn't see the *git pull* and in a panic I typed *git push* and **ENTER !**  
Talk about the sh1t hitting the fan on that one for a wee newbie like me. Truthfully, I couldn't sort it so did a *git reset -- hard orgin/master* which seemed like the best course
of action according to the internet. I lost everything I had done that day as it went back to the orginal code which was nothing tbh.

I think I figured out why it happened a few days later, and it was because I was logging into Gitpod from my Github repository, so therefore creating a new Gitpod workspace each time. 
There were like 3 or 4 workspaces with the same name and I must've been working on one different from the origin. Anyway, that's my theory & I'm sticking to it.
(it never happened again anyway and I deleted the additional workspaces in my Gitpod)


**Bug 2 Or Not 2 Bug .... That Is The Question ....**


In my Top 10 section I was looking to add iframes that played upon selection. 
I made this happen by using the **embed** selection from the share menu within the tunes youtube page.
I just copied the link part and pasted this into each link in my html because I was using one iframe to play them all.

Although I could get them to autoplay the tunes, they were always muted. I tried various options and methods, looking into YouTubes API for answers.
Unfortunately as of 2018 the [Autoplay Policy Changed](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes) and you could only autoplay now when muted.
There are some exceptions when this will work unmuted but this depends on the *the user* clicking on the links and *their settings.
You can read about it in the previous link.


**Bug 3**

I used a table for listing my About Me classification questions and answers because I thought this was the best way to display it and maintain vertically straight alignment.

Wrong ... on smaller screens it was all over the place and looked awful.
My mentor suggested just using rows, columns and divs within Bootstrap, so I looked at some Bootstrap tutorials and best practices for this online for enlightenment.
I am very happy with the way it turned out compared to using the table method.


**Bug 4**

One day my CSS code wouldn't work no matter what I tried and I spent an hour trying evrything.  
In the end I had to reboot my laptop and fortunately it all became good again.

**Bug 5**

Another day I started my Gitpod workspace and some of the index html was missing. The code at the bottom had just vanished from the previous night.
A part of my footer, my end scripts, my end body tag and my end html tag were no longer where thety should be.  
I have no answer to why this happened if the truth be told but luckily enough I was always backing my code up in Notepad 
so I simply copied and pasted the missing html code.
It worked but just be careful everyone.


## The Validation & Testing Journey

# TBC



## The Mentor Code Review Journey

It's time to panic when your mentor tells you to grab a pen and paper then take a seat ha ha, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.
He went fairly easy on me saying I just need to tidy up my HTML and CSS as it was pretty much a mess.
The main points he did mention that I had to fix were - 

* Put all **headers** within the *rows* as I started my sections, container then my headers then the row, cols and content.

* On all **'a' tags** remove *span class="sr-only"* and replace with the *aria-label* format.

* Add *validation* to my contact form.

* No pixels on scales - use REM! (which I still have to repair at this moment in time).

* Tidy CSS up and simplify my code, to reduce the size. I had similar styles being applied to each section so I added one piece of code that could apply it the all the common areas. Simplicity is key.

I know this is my first site and I had such an experience from start to finish i can assure you of that.  
I was up ... I was down ... Somedays I felt like Neo from the Matrix ... Other days I had serious Imposter Syndrome, like why the feck am I doing this because I know nothing about coding.
I would stare a bit of code and think what does that actually mean .... I don't get it.  
I really struggled with the Bootstrap grid and the fact it's Mobile First.   
Man, did that fry my head for ages.....s  
But you know what, with patience & devotion, I grinded away most nights and weekends, learning everyday and researching how to make things you want to happen in a website. 
Watching back the Code Institutes lessons again, numerous YouTube videos on everything HTML or CSS and delving into the dark corners of the Coding World to figure out why my code wasn't working they way I had anticapated

All in all, it's been one of the best expiences of my life which is a high accolade to be honest because remember .... 
I was a RaVeR .... who had a whole lot of highs in the 90s for sure ;)

Anyway being a Bedroom DJ, I deffo need to do a few shout outs to people and various places of resouced material.
