# User Experience (UI)


## Project Goals


To protray a fictional character called **DJ Snooze-A-Lot** & who is Ireland's longest serving Bedroom DJ. 
I will create a website firstly, to have a laugh at my expense but more importantly, to display the skills I have learned so far.
I just want people to have a laugh when they visit my website & enjoy the nostalgia of the 90's rave scene as well.
Ye never know though, maybe I'll become famous ..... Bedroom DJ to World SuperStar DJ **ALL** because of my website. 
How cool would that be ha ha ?


## User Goals


* Have a laugh at my expense
* Learn about the Northern Irish Rave scene
* My Top 10 Rave Tunes from back in the day (with either YouTube links built in or associated pics for each tune)
* Humerous section about up & coming tour dates / mixes / live mixes with a maximum audience of 5 allowed at my window
* Be able to listen to some 90s classics
* Updates on future raves, oldskool reunions


## User Stories


* As a user, I want to see who this crazy person that is Ireland's longest serving Bedroom DJ, actually is
* As a user, I want to have a laugh and have a smile on my face
* As a user, I want to enjoy some old classic rave tunes that I may never have heard before
* As a user, I want to enjoy am aesthetically pleasing website which is easy to navigate around
* As a user, I want to be taken back to a muddy field in the middle of nowhere, early 90s and lost in the music


## Site Owner Goals


* As a site owner, I want to make sure site visitors smile & laugh
* As a site owner, I want them to connect and love the fictional character that is DJ Snooze-A-Lot
* As a site owner, I want people to enjoy some top tunes from the 90s
* As a site owner, I want like minded ravers to relive their youth through my website
* As a site owner, I want set up a mailing list for future CD sales and updates. Also a competetion possibly on sigh up.
* As a site owner, I want people to wonder who is the man behind this crazy facade that is Irelands longest Bedroom DJ


## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements

* Scrolling website
* Professional looking website which is aesthetically pleasing
* 5 or 6 sections depending on overall look and how compact it may look
* As much funny shit as possible but in a professional manner (if possible)
* To have an email sign-up form for DJ updates, future CD's and live mixes plus a wee competetion to win a CD on sign-up

### Expectations

* The user will smile as a bare minimum but laugh if I consider my wee website a success
* They will enjoy the websire layout and navigate freely with no issues
* Good working links (pics or videos) will be provided to access my Top 10 Classics Tunes
* That fellow ravers reminisce about the good old days
* Fun stories with shit puns is always a winner in my eyes


## Design Choices

To be honest, at the start I was all for UV lighting, bright neon colours, flashing strobes and as 90s ravery (not a word but I'm using it) as I could get.
But the more I thought about it, it would have looked really awful and loud .... probably hurt the eyes to be fair. So in my head before I start to design it,
I want to keep my website relatively simple, I am going to keep it chilled out and deffo give it a relaxed feel, well until my Top 10 section ... OI OI !!!
I did some research on famous DJs amd their associated websites, just to see what kind of information is displayed there. 
Some were very similar to what I had in mind before I previewed them so I was pleasantly pleased. Some were very compact with a lot going on in such a small space.
Anyway, simple but funny is key to my design

### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration :)
Personally, I would have used big bold graffiti style fonts but I know in my heart this would have looked pretty awful to the user. 
So I have settled on the simplicity side of things & the more user friendly style of [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web)
for the main text and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) for titles and section headings.

### Icons

Font Awesome plus I'll write something later as I go along

### Colours

Unfortunately, the 90s rave scene was historically as bright and as luminous as you could get. Whites, luminous yellows, luminous oranges .... the brighter the better !
My website will not be as bright unfortunately, even though I really love the colours but I will need to tone it down to make it more aesthetically pleasing for my visitors :)
So colours I have mainly settled for are :

- Section 1 : Home / Colours will be
- Section 2 : Profile / Colours will be
- Section 3 : Backstory / Colours will be
- Section 4 : Top 10 Rave Classics
- Section 5 : Up & Coming Tour Dates (funny) / Colours will be
- Section 6 : Email Contact Form / Colours will be
