# User Experience (UI)


## Project Goals


To protray a fictional character called **DJ Snooze-A-Lot** & who is Ireland's longest serving Bedroom DJ. 
I will create a website firstly, to have a laugh at my expense but more importantly, to display the skills I have learned so far.
I just want people to have a laugh when they visit my website & enjoy the nostalgia of the 90's rave scene as well.
Ye never know though, maybe I'll become famous ..... Bedroom DJ to World SuperStar DJ **ALL** because of my website. 
How cool would that be ha ha ?


## User Goals

* Learn about the Northern Irish Rave scene
* My Top 10 Rave Tunes from back in the day (with either YouTube links built in or associated pics for each tune)
* Humerous section about up & coming tour dates / mixes / live mixes with a maximum audience of 5 allowed at my window
* Be able to listen to some 90s classics
* Updates on future raves, oldskool reunions


## User Stories

* As a user, I want to enjoy some old classic rave tunes that I may never have heard before
* As a user, I want to enjoy am aesthetically pleasing website which is easy to navigate around

* As a site owner, I want people to wonder who is the man behind this crazy facade that is Irelands longest Bedroom DJ


## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements

* Scrolling website
* Professional looking website which is aesthetically pleasing
* 5 or 6 sections depending on overall look and how compact it may look
* As much funny shit as possible but in a professional manner (if possible)
* To have an email sign-up form for DJ updates, future CD's and live mixes plus a wee competetion to win a CD on sign-up

### Expectations

* The user will smile as a bare minimum but laugh if I consider my wee website a success
* They will enjoy the websire layout and navigate freely with no issues
* Good working links (pics or videos) will be provided to access my Top 10 Classics Tunes
* That fellow ravers reminisce about the good old days
* Fun stories with shit puns is always a winner in my eyes


## Design Choices

To be honest, at the start I was all for UV lighting, bright neon colours, flashing strobes and as 90s ravery (not a word but I'm using it) as I could get.
But the more I thought about it, it would have looked really awful and loud .... probably hurt the eyes to be fair. So in my head before I start to design it,
I want to keep my website relatively simple, I am going to keep it chilled out and deffo give it a relaxed feel, well until my Top 10 section ... OI OI !!!
I did some research on famous DJs amd their associated websites, just to see what kind of information is displayed there. 
Some were very similar to what I had in mind before I previewed them so I was pleasantly pleased. Some were very compact with a lot going on in such a small space.
Anyway, simple but funny is key to my design

### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration :)
Personally, I would have used big bold graffiti style fonts but I know in my heart this would have looked pretty awful to the user. 
So I have settled on the simplicity side of things & the more user friendly style of [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web)
for the main text and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) for titles and section headings.

Below is an example of my fonts where the title is in Lato and the text is in Titillium Web .....

### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require. 
I will deffo be using the various social media icons out there on my website.
Other than them, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.


### Colours

Unfortunately, the 90s rave scene was historically as bright and as luminous as you could get. Whites, luminous yellows, luminous oranges .... the brighter the better !
My website will not be as bright unfortunately, even though I really love the colours but I will need to tone it down to make it more aesthetically pleasing for my visitors :)
So the colours I have mainly settled for are :

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***Cultured***        |#F8F9FA    |Off White          |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Lavender Floral*** |#B696ED    |Soft Purple        |Body background, menu selections|
|***Fiery Rose***      |#EB5C68    |Soft Red           |Body background, menu selections|
|***Charleston Green***|#212529    |Off Black          |Body background, text & titles  |

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

# Wireframes

The software that I used for my **wireframes** was [***Balsamiq***](https://balsamiq.com/).
This was the first time I used such software so it was a whole new learning curve for me. 
The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile.
They are just simple 2D sketches but I have quickly found out how important these really are:)

You can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

- [Desktop Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/Bedroom-DJ/raw/master/wireframes/desktop-wireframe.pdf)
- [Tablet Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/Bedroom-DJ/raw/master/wireframes/tablet-wireframe.pdf)
- [Mobile Wireframe](https://github.com/RaVeR76/Bedroom-DJ/raw/master/wireframes/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

When I first started thinking about how my website was going to look, I automatically thought on a multi-page design as that's what I was used to seeing on the internet.
After my initial discussion with my cool mentor, he said a scrolling single page would be more suitable to my design and content.
I realised this was the correct direction when designing my wireframes and also when researching other websites out there.

# Testing

# Bugs

Before October 2020 the only encounter I had with websites was viewing them as a so called 'user'.
Fast forward 3 months and I'm fairly close to handing in my first MS1 project and therefore my first ever website .... unbelieveable.
I knew it was gonna be tough at times due to my inexperience but me, being stubborn and persistant, kept going & learning everyday.
One day I sat for 2 to 3 hours trying to figure out why my code ain't working .... fecking TYPO !!! But you learn from such dishearting experiences ha ha, believe me :)

Anyway, it's all about bugs
