                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                There were so many World famous DJs around that time to be honest but for me, of course it would have to be our very own wee home grown legends.
                                Week in, week out these <b>GODS</b> took us to spiritual places that we still dream about to this day..... UNBELIEVABLE MEMORIES :)
                                <br>But before I give a shout out for the home grown uns, a special mention to my favourite
                                non-Norn Ironish DJ, Scotlands own <b>DJ PADDY FRAZER</b>. You always knew when that man was on the ones and twos,
                                it was gonna be a banging, bouncy night fot sure.
                                <br>Anyways, my homies in no particualr order are :
                                <br><b>DJ SCI</b>, <em>The Trance Master</em>, man can that dude mix. He will take you on a journey to a different dimension with his tuneage selection and
                                the perfect way he blends them together.
                                <br><b>DJ BINMAN</b>, <em>The Hardcore Master</em>, Ballymena's very own and an absolute gentleman but on the decks, his sets are made to wreck the place.  
                                <br>Last but not least, the man the myth the legend ..... <br><b>DJ X-RAY</b>. <em>The Head Master</em> of Oldskool, his legendary status speaks for itself. 
                                This Leg End has it all and every time he DJs, without fail, he brings a smile to my face and puts a glow in the old ticker.
                                You just stand there in a wee daze, thinking about his <em>last sets of the night.</em> The lights come on, the lower barn mosh pit is going completely mental at the last two or three bangers 
                                he delivers us at the end o thy night, ye know, for the wee trip wherever ......                                
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-12 craic-style">
                            <h5>
                                What was your favourite club back in the day?
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                I know there were a few awesome clubs back in the 90's that had there own 'rave families', each being an integral part of their club and the whole rave scene in general.
                                I did manage to venture to a few of them and seriously enjoyed every single one of them. The atmosphere was always electric and buzzing. Clubs like Circus Circus, Kilwaughter House, 
                                The Arena just to name a few.<br>
                                But for me though, only one club stood out above the rest, <b>The Rave Cave</b> at <em>Ballymena Sports Bowl !!!</em><br>
                                Only messing it has to be <b>KELLYS</b>.
                                From the DJs that made it happen to the iconic atmosphere, it all came together on a Saturday night, for one outstanding <em><b>dove-downed loved-up huggy sweatfest.</b></em><br>
                                Now a days it's pyjamas, slippers and a cup of tea .... although, I do sometimes wish I was wee Marty McFly ..... just so I could go back for one more night !

                                From the minute you opened your eyes on the Saturday morning, you had that <b>Rave Day Buzz</b> in your stomach. As the day went on the buzz got bigger and stronger until the journey began.
                                Maybe you were the designated driver or passenger in a car, on the mad dog buses or you were just public transported to Portrush, either way the end game was <b>The Big K.</b>
                                Standing in the queue, everyone buzzing, yarning with familiar faces, building the excitement for an awesome night. As you got closer to the turnstyles, you scanned the bouncers to see who was on.
                                <br>The weekly <b>"Operation Invisa-pill"</b> was initiated and it was time to try navigate past the bouncers, doing your best 'sober' impression possible.
                                Your heart was racing faster now as you heard the bass getting louder walking towards the main doors, you could feel the buzz already.
                                Only there was one last challenge .... payment time ! Who knew a simple human to human transaction could become seriously complicated when your hands turned to jelly, the floor became marshmallow 
                                and the wee man behind the glass, had a face which rearranged itself every 3 milliseconds ....<br>
                                Once past all pre-rave obstacles, you zoned into the music immediately, you found your perfect spot and for the next few hours ..... <b>You were free !</b>

                <p>
                    I have loads of good memories to be honest, some pretty clear and some not so clear, like standing on the stage in the barn, 
                    hands on hips taking a breather, watching 2 or 3 thousand happy smiling ravers dance without a care in the world. 
                    For a few hours we could be whoever we wanted to be :)
                    I have to say that one of my favourite memories was <b>HARMONY 9</b> with <em>DJ Carl Cox, Love Decade, Glen Molloy and X-Ray.</em> I think there were 3,500 ravers crammed in that night.
                    You could hardly move, you could hardly breathe, sweat was dripping of the ceiling it was that warm but still one of the best nights I ever had in the place.
                    Train down and no way home .... who cares !
                    The atmosphere was unbelievable as usual but there was buzz talk about an after party at the <b>Caves in Ballintoy.</b>
                    As the night continued the music was incredible and the energy was electric. The afterparty snowball kept gathering pace (not an actual snowball by the way).   
                    <br>
                    <br>                   
                    Once Kellys was over and you left the cauldron of heat into the not so warm <b>Portrush</b> sea air, steam flying of you like a boiling kettle.
                    Call me sadistic but I always loved the after part; trying to find a caravan, a house, a car, anywhere to continue the party.
                    On a evening that started as a foursome had now reduced to a twosome, as my mate and I had lost the other two of our party ..... standard practise to be honest, plus remember no phones either.                               
                    Anyhow, there's us two strutting through the car park thinking we're <em>Crocket and Tubbs from Miami Vice</em> when in fact we were probably more like a couple of extras from <em>Dawn Of The Dead.</em>
                    Simply looking for a lift either home to Ballymena (really not an option in all honesty) or the next party ... with the Caves being our prefered destination of choice that very morning.
                    So back to strutting, there we were knocking on car windows, buses or just asking random ravers <em>"What they were doing now?"</em> or <em>"Where they were going?"</em> obviously after the usual initial question 
                    <em><b>"Did ye have good night?"</b></em> This was fairly standard after Kellys etiquette.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Anyways, we were running out of luck. Cars were full , people going in wrong direction or home, it was looking like we might have to float about Portrush for the next 8 or 10 hours until the train home arrived.
                    I will never forget the next few hours as long as I live because we had basically given up all hope and about to head out of Kellys car park when I noticed a wee white Polo sitting right beside the exit.
                    I said to my mate <em>"Last chance sham"</em> so I knocked on the window. A girl wound, yes wound, her window down; there were two of them and I said <em>"What's the craic ladies .... did you have a good night?"</em>
                    They said they weren't in Kellys but somewhere else but just heard about a massive after party down at the caves, in Ballintoy.
                    I said <em>"In that case any chance of a lift?". "Bounce in"</em> they said, even though we didn't know them from Adam but that was just the way it was back then.
                    They were two cool girls for sure.

                    So me and my mate jump in for the long, unbearable 14 odd mile journey to the said 'Caves'.
                    Once we got there, probably between 2am to 3am sometime. Ravers really have no idea of what time it is and the party just has to keep going.
                    We could see loads of cars already there so we knew it was gonna be mega. Close to the cave entrance was a big red van with decks and huge sound system inside it, already pumping out the tunes.
                    Everyone was dancing, smiling and loving life. My mate says as soon as I got out of the car I was raving away then projectile vomit came out but my wee right arm , with white glove on, was still cutting shapes as I threw my guts up ha ha.
                    He or I will never forget that image.
                    After I got myself composed with a drink of water and a smoke, we headed up into the heart of the cave with all the other mad ravers.
                    Standing amongst 100 to 200 happy ravers raving until the sun came up will never ever fade from my memory, as much as everything else has, this will not.
                    Whilst most ravers dream of of the white isle Ibiza .... <b>I dream of wee Ballintoy in 1993 !!!</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em>Eternity magazine</em>, a rave scene mag at the time, was there and took a few pictures for one of it's editions which I have kept to this day. 
                    See the pic above - flares, pumping beat, hands in the air posse and happy faces all around is what it was all about.
                    The funny thing was that we found our other two mates who had managed to get a lift down as well. You honestly couldn't write it.
                    The night became morning and the sun came up, bit like us ravers the previous evening ... oi oi. It was shining brighter than ever it seemed.
                    As we raved on, the car park got emptier and emptier. I'm not sure where the two girls got to, now I think about it but they were probably long gone.
                    I think we were one of the last crews to leave but while everyone else had cars or a lift, we had to walk the whole way back to Portrush, to catch our train.
                    I remember asking the last car any chance of a lift but they were full. They drove by tooting the horn in happiness and I'm sure there were at least 10 people in that wee wagon.
                    There were people hanging out of the windows and all, crazy times and something you wouldn't get away with now.
                    So I'd say the <b>13.9 mile trek</b> along that beautiful coastal route (added bonus), took us 5 or 6 hours but like I said, the sun was beaming gloriously, 
                    like my big happy face replaying the last few hours over and over again, in my wee mangled head !
