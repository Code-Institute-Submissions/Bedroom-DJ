                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                There were so many World famous DJs around that time to be honest but for me, of course it would have to be our very own wee home grown legends.
                                Week in, week out these <b>GODS</b> took us to spiritual places that we still dream about to this day..... UNBELIEVABLE MEMORIES :)
                                <br>But before I give a shout out for the home grown uns, a special mention to my favourite
                                non-Norn Ironish DJ, Scotlands own <b>DJ PADDY FRAZER</b>. You always knew when that man was on the ones & twos,
                                it was gonna be a banging, bouncy night fot sure.
                                <br>Anyways, my homies in no particualr order are :
                                <br>
                                <br><b>DJ SCI</b>, <em>The Trance Master</em>, man can that dude mix. He will take you on a journey to a different dimension with his tuneage selection &
                                the perfect way he blends them together.
                                <br><b>DJ BINMAN</b>, <em>The Hardcore Master</em>, Ballymena's very own & an absolute gentleman but on the decks, his sets are made to wreck the place.  
                                <br>Last but not least, the man the myth the legend ..... <br><b>DJ X-RAY</b>. <em>The Head Master</em> of Oldskool, his legendary status speaks for itself. 
                                This Leg End has it all & every time he DJs, without fail, he brings a smile to my face & puts a glow in the old ticker.
                                Me just standing there dazed thinking about his last sets of the night. Lights on, the lower barn mosh pit going mental at last two or three bangers 
                                he delivers us at the end, ye know, for the wee trip where ever ......                                
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-12 craic-style">
                            <h5>
                                What was your favourite club back in the day?
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                I know there were a few awesome clubs back in the 90's that had there own 'rave families', each being an integral part of their club & the whole rave scene in general.
                                I did manage to venture to a few of them & seriuosly enjoyed every single one of them. The atmosphere was always electric & buzzing. Clubs like Circus Circus, Kilwaughter House, 
                                The Arena just to name a few.<br>
                                For me though, only one club stood out above the rest, <b>The Rave Cave</b> at <em>Ballymena Sports Bowl !</em><br>
                                Only messing it has to be <b>KELLYS</b>.
                                From the DJs that made it happen to the iconic atmosphere, it all came together on a Saturday night, for one outstanding dove loved huggy sweat fest.<br>
                                Now a days, I sometimes wish I was wee Marty McFly ..... just so I could go back for one more night !
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Describe a typical Rave Saturday (keep it clean)?
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                I frequented the place every Saturday without fail .... sometimes on a Wednesday for the cheapy student night & sometimes on a Friday for the Euro Dance themed night or whatever it was about.
                                But these detours mid-week was only ever leading to the Big Night ..... Saturday ! And the odd Easter Monday All Dayer, can't forget about them.
                                From the minute you opened your eyes on the Saturday morning, you had that Rave Day Buzz in your stomach. As the day went on the buzz got bigger & stronger until the journey began.
                                Maybe you were the designated driver or passenger in a car, on the mad dog buses or you were just public transported to Portrush, either way the end game was The Big K.
                                Standing in the queue, everyone buzzing, yarning with familar faces, building the excitement for an awesome night.

                    I have loads of good memories to be honest, some pretty clear & some not so clear, like standing on the stage in the barn, 
                    hands on hips taking a breather, watching 2 or 3 thousand happy smiling ravers dance without stress, fear or life issues. 
                    For a few hours we were ALL free :)
                    Anyways, one of my favourite memories was <b>HARMONY 9</b> with DJ Carl Cox, Love Decade, Glen Molloy & X-Ray. I think there were 3,500 ravers crammed in that night.
                    You could hardly move, you hardly breathe, sweat was dripping of the ceiling it was that warm but still one of the best nights I ever had in the place.
                    Train down & no way home .... who cares !
                    The atmosphere was unbelievable as usual but there was buzz talk about an after party at the Caves in Ballintoy.
                    As the night continued the music was incredible & the energy was electric. The afterparty snowball kept gathering pace (not an actual snowball by the way).   <br>                   
                    Once Kellys was over & you left the cauldron of heat into the not so warm Portrush sea air, steam flying of you like a boiling kettle.
                    Call me sadistic but I always loved the after part; trying to find a caravan, a house, a car, anywhere to continue the party.
                    On a evening that started as a foursome had now reduced to a twosome, as my mate & I had lost the other two of our party (remember no phones either)..... standard practise tbh.                               
                    Anyhow, there's us two strutting through the car park thinking we're Crocket & Tubbs from Miami Vice when in fact we were probably more like a couple of extras from Dawn Of The Dead.
                    Simply looking for a lift either home to Ballymena (really not an option in all honesty) or the next party ... with the Caves being our prefered destination of choice that morning.
                    So back to strutting, there we were knocking on car windows, buses or just asking random ravers "What they were doing now?" or "Where they were going?" obviously after the usual initial question 
                    "Did ye have good night?" This was fairly standard after Kellys etiquette.              
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyways, we were running out of luck. Cars were full , people going in wrong direction or home, it was looking like we might have to float about Portrush for the next 8 or 10 hours until the train home arrived.
                    I will never forget the next few hours as long as I live because we had basically given up all hope & about to head out of Kellys car park when I noticed a wee white Polo sitting right beside the exit.
                    I said to my mate "Last chance sham" so I knocked on the window. A girl wound, yes wound, her window down; there were two of them & I said "What's the craic ladies .... did you have a good night?"
                    They said they weren't in Kellys but somewhere else but just heard about a massive after party down at the caves, in Ballintoy.
                    I said "In that case any chance of a lift?". "Bounce in" they said, even though we didn't know them from Adam but that was just the way it was back then.
                    They were two cool girls for sure.
                    So me & my mate jump in for the long, unbearable 13.9 mile journey to the said 'Caves'.

                    Once we got there , probably between 2am to 3am sometime. Ravers really have no idea of what time it is & the party just has to keep going.
                    We could see loads of cars already there so we knew it was gonna be mega. Close to the cave entrance was a big red van with decks & huge sound system inside it, already pumping out the tunes.
                    Everyone was dancing, smiling & loving life. My mate says as soon as I got out of the car I was raving but then projectile vomit came out but my wee right arm , with white glove on, I was still cutting shapes as I threw my guts up ha ha.
                    He or I will never forget that image.

                    After I got myself composed with a drink of water & a smoke, we heading up into the heart of the cave with all the other mad ravers.
                    Standing amongst 100 to 200 happy ravers raving until the sun came up will never ever fade from my memory, as much as everything else has, this will not.
                    Whilst most ravers dream of of the white isle Ibiza .... I dream of wee Ballintoy in 1993 !!!

                    Eternity magazine, a rave scene mag at the time, was there & took a few pictures for an edition of theres which I have kept to this day. 
                    See the pic below - flares, pumping beat, hands in the air posse & happy faces all around is what it was all about.
                    The funny thing was that we found our other two mates who had managed to get a lift down as well. You couldn't write it.
                    The night became morning & the sun came up, bit like us ravers the previous evening ... oi oi. It was shining brighter than ever it seemed.
                    As we raved on, the car park got emptier & emptier. I'm not sure where the two girls got to now I think about it but probably long gone.
                    I think we were one of the last crews to leave but while everyone else had cars or a lift, we had to walk the whole way back to Portrush, to catch our train.
                    I remember asking the last car any chance of a lift but they were full. They drove by tooting the horn in happiness & i'm sure there were at least 10 people in that wee thing.
                    There were people hanging out of the windows & all, crazy times & something you wouldn't get away with now.
                    So I'd say the 12.9 mile trek took us 5 or 6 hours but like I said, the sun was beaming gloriously like my big happy face replaying the past few hours in my head.
